    Onam is the biggest festival in the Indian state of Kerala. Onam Festival falls during the Malayali month of Chingam
    (Aug - Sep) and marks the homecoming of legendary King Mahabali. Carnival of Onam lasts for ten days and brings out the
    best of Kerala culture and tradition. Intricately decorated Pookalam, ambrosial Onasadya, breathtaking Snake Boat Race
    and exotic Kaikottikali dance are some of the most remarkable features of Onam - the harvest festival in Kerala. <br>
    Onam is also a harvest festival. It is celebrated at a time when everything appears so nice and good. The beautiful
    landscape of Kerala can be seen in its full radiance at this time of the Malayalam New Year. Weather, it seems, also
    seeks to be a part of the festival. It contributes by becoming pleasantly warm and sunny. Fields look brilliant with a
    bountiful harvest. Farmers feel on top of the world as they watch the result of their hard labour with pride.
